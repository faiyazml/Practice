# ML & Python Practice Repository

Welcome to my **practice repository**, where I regularly upload my learning and code related to:

* âœ… Python fundamentals
* âœ… NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
* âœ… Data preprocessing and EDA
* âœ… Machine Learning algorithms (Scikit-learn)
* âœ… Practice exercises, small projects, and Jupyter Notebooks

## ðŸ“š Purpose of this Repository

> **Main aim:** Practice daily and track my growth as a future Machine Learning Engineer.

Here I:

* Explore concepts taught in my ML course from IIT Patna (via Intellipaat)
* Apply them through hands-on notebooks
* Build a habit of version control using Git & GitHub
